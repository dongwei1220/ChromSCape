\title{Filter lowly correlated cells}
\usage{
filter_correlated_cell_scExp(
  scExp,
  random_iter = 50,
  corr_threshold = 99,
  percent_correlation = 1,
  verbose = T,
  seed = 47
)
}
\arguments{
\item{scExp}{A SingleCellExperiment object containing 'Cor', a correlation matrix, in reducedDims.}

\item{random_iter}{Number of random matrices to create to calculate random correlation scores. [50]}

\item{corr_threshold}{Quantile of random correlation score above which a cell is considered 
to be 'correlated' with another cell. [99]}

\item{percent_correlation}{Percentage of the cells that any cell must be 'correlated' to in order to
not be filtered. [1]}

\item{verbose}{[T]}

\item{seed}{Random seed. [47]}
}
\value{
Returns a SingleCellExperiment object without lowly correlated cells. The
calculated correlation score limit threshold is saved in metadata.
}
\description{
Remove cells that have a correlation score lower than what would be 
expected by chance with other cells.
}
\details{
This functions takes as input a SingleCellExperiment object that must have correlation
matrix calculated and outputs a SingleCellExperiment object without lowly correlated cells. 
TSNE is recalculated.
