\item{enrichment_qval}{Adjusted p-value threshold for gene set enrichment. [0.1]}

\item{ref}{A reference annotation. ["hg38"]}

\item{GeneSets}{A named list of gene sets. If NULL will automatically load MSigDB list
of gene sets for specified reference genome. [NULL]}

\item{GeneSetsDf}{A dataframe containing gene sets & class of gene sets. If NULL will automatically 
load MSigDB dataframe of gene sets for specified reference genome. [NULL]}

\item{GenePool}{The pool of genes to run enrichment in. If NULL will automatically load 
Gencode list of genes fro specified reference genome. [NULL]}

\item{qval.th}{Adjusted p-value threshold to define differential features. [0.01]}

\item{cdiff.th}{Fold change threshold to define differential features. [1]}

\item{peak_distance}{Maximum distance of feature to gene TSS to consider associated, in bp. [1000]}

\item{use_peaks}{Use peak calling method (must be calculated beforehand). [F]}

\item{peak_window}{If use_peaks is TRUE, the peak_window object calculated during peak calling. [NULL]}

}
\value{
Returns a SingleCellExperiment object containing list of enriched Gene Sets for each cluster, either
in depleted features, enriched features or simply differential features (both).
}
\description{
This function takes previously calculated differential features and runs hypergeometric test
to look for enriched gene sets in the genes associated with differential features, for each cell 
cluster.
This functions takes as input a SingleCellExperiment object with consclust, the type of comparison, either 
'one_vs_rest' or 'pairwise', the adjusted p-value threshold (qval.th) and the fold-change threshold (cdiff.th). 
It outputs a SingleCellExperiment object containing a differential list.
