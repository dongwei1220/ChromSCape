\title{Correlation and hierarchical clustering}
\usage{
correlation_and_hierarchical_clust_scExp(
  scExp,
  correlation = "pearson",
  hc_linkage = "ward.D"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{scExp}{A SingleCellExperiment object, containing 'PCA' in reducedDims.}

\item{correlation}{A correlation method to use. See \link[stats]{hclust}. ["pearson"]}

\item{hc_linkage}{A linkage method for hierarchical clustering. See \link[stats]{cor}. ["ward.D"]}
}
\value{
Return a SingleCellExperiment object with correlation matrix & hiearchical clustering.
}
\description{
Calculates cell to cell correlation matrix based on the PCA feature space
and runs hierarchical clustering taking 1 - correlation scores as distance.
}
\details{
This functions takes as input a SingleCellExperiment object that must have PCA calculated 
and outputs a SingleCellExperiment object with correlation matrix and hierarchical clustering.
