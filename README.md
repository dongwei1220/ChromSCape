## What is ChromSCape ?

ChromSCape - Single-Cell Chromatin Landscape profiling - is a ready-to-launch user-friendly Shiny App for analysis of single-cell epigenomic datasets (scChIP-seq, scATAC-seq...) from count matrices to differential analysis & gene set enrichment analysis. ScChIPseq data can be produced using experimental protocol described in Grosselin et Al. (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-0424-9). The user should input one or many count matrices (in .txt or .tsv format, see [Test datasets](#Test-datasets) for details about input format). 

## Launch the App 

ChromSCape requires R version 3.5.0. To install ChromSCape, open R or Rstudio and copy the following commands : 

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("vallotlab/ChromSCape", ref = "package")
```

Once the installation was sucessful, launch ChromSCape using the following command :

```
library(ChromSCape)
ChromSCape::launchApp()
```

It is recommended to use Chrome browser for optimal display of graphics & table.
If no browser opens, copy the url after 'Listening on ...' and paste in your browser.

Play around by inputing a simple matrix (unzip first): [single-cell ChIP-seq matrix - HBCx95 (H3K27me3 mark)](inst/extdata/example_matrix.tsv.zip)

## Test datasets

ChromSCape takes as input one tab-separated count matrice (in .tsv or .txt) per sample. In order to upload multiple matrices, the matrices should be placed in the same folder of your computer. Before
you input your own matrices, it is recommended you try playing around and familiarize
with ChromSCape by downloading our example matrices and uploading them in ChromSCape :



Input count matrices corresponding to mouse cells from 2 PDX models, luminal and triple negative breast cancer tumours resistant or not to cancer therapy (respectively HBCx_22 & HBCx_95, see Grosselin et al., 2019) are available at https://figshare.com/projects/Single-Cell_ChIP-seq_of_Mouse_Stromal_Cells_in_PDX_tumour_models_of_resistance/66419 (theses count matrices have been processed using our latest data engineering pipeline, see https://github.com/vallotlab/scChIPseq_DataEngineering). The optional peak calling step requires  BAM files (also available on Figshare) to improve gene set enrichment analysis.

Alternatively, a ready-to-use pre-compiled analysis folder for HBCx22 & HBCx95 mouse H3K27me3 datasets is available at : https://figshare.com/articles/ChromSCape_scChIP_scATAC_compiled_datasets/11854371. A similar pre-compiled folder is available for the analysis of single-cell ATAC seq datasets from (Buenrostro et al., 2015, Corces et al., 2016, Schep et al., 2017). Download and uncompress the directory. Once in ChromSCape, select the directory containing the "dataset" folder to start exploring. 

## Run Time

On a Intel® Core™ i5-6500 CPU @ 3.20GHz × 4 with 31,3 Gio RAM, the installation took less than one hour. The running time of of scChIP_H3K27me3 test dataset was 25 minutes without peak calling and 35 minutes with peak calling.

## Input

The matrix format should be tab-separated file, with Cells as column & Features 
as rows. The first line should be cell names, the first column should be feature 
names. Feature names can be either genomic coordinate in the format 'chr:start-end'
or 'chr_start_end' or gene symbols (e.g: A1BG, A1BG-AS1 for hg38 or Rab23, Bag2 
for mm10).

## Output

The app automatically creates a directory **datasets** in which a new directory is created for each analysis with a different input name. Inside that directory are created a directory for each part of the analysis, containing RData and figures.
  
## Other

The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis is based on MSIG database (http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb).


## Requirements

Before the first time you run the App, launch the **installation script** `Rscript ./installation_script.R` to install all the dependencies required.

Some softwares are required. Bedtools is necessary to run the Filtering step while you only need Macs2 & Samtools for the optional peak calling step.

```
  samtools 1.9 (Using htslib 1.9) (http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html)
  bedtools v2.25.0 (https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2/releases/tag/v2.25.0)
  macs2 2.1.2 (https://github.com/taoliu/MACS)
```

## Detailed walkthrough of the App
### 1. Upload your matrice(s)
### 2. Name & compile dataset
### 3. Fix filters to keep most covered regions & cells
### 4. Vizualize data in reduced dimension
### 5. Correlate cells and filter out cells with low correlation scores
### 6. Cluster cells
### 7. Peak call to refine signal (optional)
### 8. Find differentially bound regions in each cluster
### 9. Find enriched gene sets in differentially bound regions
